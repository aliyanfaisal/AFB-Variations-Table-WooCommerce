## WooCommerce Variation Table + Dynamic Pricing Tiers Plugin

An awesome WordPress WooCommerce plugin that replaces the standard variation dropdowns on the product page with a **modern, user-friendly variation table**.  
This makes selecting product variations faster, clearer, and more intuitive for customers.

In addition, the plugin includes a **built-in Dynamic Pricing Tiers System**, allowing you to automatically adjust product prices based on the quantity selected. You can create multiple tiers, each with its own discount settings.
